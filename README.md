### 🧠 Why Design Properties Matter

Identifying and adhering to the design properties in a mockup is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Visual Consistency:** Ensures a unified look and feel across the entire application.
- **Development Accuracy:** Developers can match the exact styles specified, reducing guesswork.
- **User Experience:** Consistent typography and color usage create a more intuitive and professional UI.
- **Branding:** Helps maintain brand identity by following predefined style guides.
- **Design-Dev Communication:** Provides a shared visual language that bridges the gap between designers and developers.

By extracting and applying Figma’s design specifications, we create a pixel-perfect and user-friendly interface that meets both aesthetic and functional standards.
