#### 🔤 Typography

| Use Case          | Font Family | Font Weight | Font Size |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Primary Font**  | Circular    | Medium (500)| 16px      |
| **Headings**      | Circular    | Bold (700)  | 24px–32px |
| **Secondary Text**| Circular    | Book (400)  | 14px      |

*Note: If the Circular font is unavailable, use a modern sans-serif alternative like Inter, Helvetica, or Arial.*

### 🧠 Why Design Properties Matter

Identifying and adhering to the design properties in a mockup is crucial for the following reasons:

- **Visual Consistency:** Ensures a unified look and feel across the entire application.
- **Development Accuracy:** Developers can match the exact styles specified, reducing guesswork.
- **User Experience:** Consistent typography and color usage create a more intuitive and professional UI.
- **Branding:** Helps maintain brand identity by following predefined style guides.
- **Design-Dev Communication:** Provides a shared visual language that bridges the gap between designers and developers.

By extracting and applying Figma’s design specifications, we create a pixel-perfect and user-friendly interface that meets both aesthetic and functional standards.

### 📐 Component Design Goals

- **Reusability:** Each component should be designed for reuse across multiple pages or sections.
- **Consistency:** Typography, colors, and spacing will follow the Figma design system.
- **Responsiveness:** All components will adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Accessibility:** Components will follow accessibility standards (e.g., proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

By building these components as isolated, well-structured units, we can accelerate development and maintain a clean, scalable codebase.
